Since a lot of you were asking for Recalbox support, we decided to create a script for it. But before we start, there are just a couple of things that you need to know about Recalbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing about Recalbox is that it is created using <a href=\"https:\/\/buildroot.org\/\">Buildroot<\/a>, which makes it very minimal &#8211; which also makes it a little low with nice features such as the Debian&#8217;s* package management tool <strong>apt<\/strong>. The original script uses <a href=\"https:\/\/gpiozero.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/\">GPIOZero<\/a>, a nice and easy Python module for controlling the GPIO. It is easily installed using <strong>apt<\/strong>. Since Recalbox doesn&#8217;t have this, this script won&#8217;t use the GPIOZero. The reason why we wanted to use GPIOZero instead of the &#8220;lower-level&#8221; RPi.GPIO module is that because we wanted you to &#8220;hack&#8221; your Rasptendo. You can see the Python script at \/opt\/Rasptendo\/halt_wake.py in your RetroPie. Feel free to do some configuration but make sure you know what you&#8217;re doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, Recalbox&#8217;s support for GPIO3 as a power button doesn&#8217;t work the same as much as typical Raspberry Pi OS. It doesn&#8217;t allow holding which means it shuts down your Pi simultaneously once you press it. But enough of the talking&#8211;here&#8217;s your script for Recalbox. (Remember to connect your Recalbox to the internet)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">wget --no-check-certificate -O - \n\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/Argon40Tech\/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch\/master\/recalbox_install.sh\" | bash<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry if the script runs too\nfast, it does what it does, but the script does not make use of GPIOZero (takes\na little time to download) in exchange for a little more complicated <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Argon40Tech\/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch\/blob\/master\/halt_wake_non_gpiozero.py\">Python script<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<strong>*Note:<\/strong> Raspbian is\nDebian-based and RetroPie is built on top of Raspbian which makes RetroPie a\n&#8220;Debian-based operating system&#8221;)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before this blog, the Rasptendo script worked only for RetroPie (arguably the most popular emulation OS for Raspberry Pi).
