<p><strong><em>What are the specs of the Raspberry
Pi Zero?</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong>
     A Broadcom BCM2835 application, with a 1GHz ARM11 core</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>
     512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong>
     1 x micro-SD card slot</li><li><strong>Video out:</strong>
     1 x mini-HDMI socket for 1080p60 video output (needs mini-HDMI-HDMI
     adapter)</li><li><strong>Ports:</strong>
     1 x USB On The Go port (needs USB OTG to USB adapter), micro USB port for
     power.</li><li><strong>Expansion:</strong>
     An unpopulated 40-pin GPIO header with identical pinout to Model A+/B+. An
     unpopulated composite video header, CSI camera connector</li><li><strong>Size:</strong>
     65mm x 30mm x 5mm</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong>
     9g</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>What is the difference between the
Raspberry Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi Zero W?</em></strong></p>



<p>The only difference between the Pi
Zero and Pi Zero W is that the Pi Zero W has</p>



<ol><li>Bluetooth 4.1</li><li>Bluetooth Low Energy</li><li>802.11 b/g/n Wireless LAN</li></ol>



<p><strong>Ports of Raspberry Pi Zero and
Raspberry Pi Zero W?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Ports:</strong>
     1 x USB On The Go port (needs USB OTG to USB adapter), micro USB port for
     power.</li><li><strong>Expansion:</strong>
     An unpopulated 40-pin GPIO header with identical pinout to Model A+/B+. An
     unpopulated composite video header, CSI camera connector</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Why can’t I purchase more than one
at a time?</em></strong></p>



<p>Because we want as many people as
possible to get a chance to purchase the Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why are there packs sometimes with
the Pi Zero W even when there aren’t any Pi Zero Ws in stock?</em></strong></p>



<p>We want to try to balance the demand
on kits and individual boards. The Pi Zero W really is a barebones computer and
you would definitely need accessories to make projects and use the Pi Zero to
its full potential.</p>



<p><strong><em>How long does it take to ship?</em></strong></p>



<p>7-14 days, depending on your
location.</p>



<p><strong><em>Where can we ship to?</em></strong></p>



<p>Virtually everywhere. As long as our
website can accepts your order we can ship it you.</p>

<p>Before this blog, the Rasptendo script worked only for RetroPie (arguably the most popular emulation OS for Raspberry Pi). Since a lot of you were asking for Recalbox support, we decided to create a script for it. But before we start, there are just a couple of things that you need to know about Recalbox.</p>



<p>The first thing about Recalbox is that it is created using <a href="https://buildroot.org/">Buildroot</a>, which makes it very minimal &#8211; which also makes it a little low with nice features such as the Debian&#8217;s* package management tool <strong>apt</strong>. The original script uses <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a>, a nice and easy Python module for controlling the GPIO. It is easily installed using <strong>apt</strong>. Since Recalbox doesn&#8217;t have this, this script won&#8217;t use the GPIOZero. The reason why we wanted to use GPIOZero instead of the &#8220;lower-level&#8221; RPi.GPIO module is that because we wanted you to &#8220;hack&#8221; your Rasptendo. You can see the Python script at /opt/Rasptendo/halt_wake.py in your RetroPie. Feel free to do some configuration but make sure you know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>Secondly, Recalbox&#8217;s support for GPIO3 as a power button doesn&#8217;t work the same as much as typical Raspberry Pi OS. It doesn&#8217;t allow holding which means it shuts down your Pi simultaneously once you press it. But enough of the talking&#8211;here&#8217;s your script for Recalbox. (Remember to connect your Recalbox to the internet)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wget --no-check-certificate -O - 
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Argon40Tech/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch/master/recalbox_install.sh" | bash</pre>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry if the script runs too
fast, it does what it does, but the script does not make use of GPIOZero (takes
a little time to download) in exchange for a little more complicated <a href="https://github.com/Argon40Tech/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch/blob/master/halt_wake_non_gpiozero.py">Python script</a>.</p>



<p>(<strong>*Note:</strong> Raspbian is
Debian-based and RetroPie is built on top of Raspbian which makes RetroPie a
&#8220;Debian-based operating system&#8221;)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The RASPTENDO Retro Gaming Case is
currently the slickest enclosure for your Raspberry Pi 3. The SNES inspired
design brings back the fun and nostalgia of the roaring sounds of 90&#8217;s and the quintessential
images of the 16-bit graphics of the time.</p>



<p>When installed with a game emulator, like Retropie, your Raspberry Pi 3 with the RASPTENDO Retro gaming case becomes a display-worthy SNES inspired console for any living room or game room.</p>



<p>The RASPTENDO Case resolves the
common issues when turning your Raspberry Pi 3 into a game or entertainment
console. Primarily most cases out there are straight out ugly. The RASPTENDO
case brings in the nostalgic flair to a barebones Raspberry Pi 3.</p>



<p>Personally, I never liked the placement of the HDMI and power sockets when fitted with most of the cases on the market. Everything seems unnatural especially when you need to access the USB port and LAN port. You know what I mean when you have used your Raspberry Pi long enough.</p>



<p>The RASPTENDO Case form factor basically not only makes your Raspberry Pi visually appealing but functionally better. The following design consideration and features allows for better user experience for the Raspberry Pi 3 either as a game console or entertainment system – and maybe even as a regular Linux computer on your desktop.</p>



<p>The Rasptendo Case provides for the
following:</p>



<ul><li>Rear access to HDMI and power cables</li><li>Functional POWER and RESET Buttons</li><li>Front USB Access</li><li>Easy access to micro SD card</li></ul>



<p>For more information, you can visit <a href="https://rasptendo.com">https://rasptendo.com</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You now have your new <strong>Rasptendo Case</strong>. Now it’s
time for you to assemble and configure it along with your Raspberry Pi 3 to
transform it into the Rasptendo retro gaming console.</p>



<p>The Rasptendo Package Box comes with</p>



<ul><li>Rasptendo Case</li><li>2 male to female USB extender</li><li>POWER and RESET Button PCB Board</li><li>6 labeled female to female jumper wires</li><li>2 male GPIO header</li><li>Installation guide</li><li>heat sink</li></ul>



<p>The POWER button issues a safe shutdown command to your Raspberry Pi to
prevent damage to your SD card. For the RESET button, you can have two (2)
options &#8211; one for the soft reboot, and one for the hard reset.</p>



<p>Option 1 for the RESET button issues a soft reboot, which is the safe way
(for your SD Card) of rebooting. It&#8217;s the same as issuing a <code>sudo reboot</code> in the terminal. It&#8217;s
especially useful when you transfer ROMs via WiFi and you have to reboot for
the RetroPie to discover the newly transferred games. The minor downside to
this option is that if your Raspberry Pi hangs (which happens rarely), the
button won&#8217;t work. That is why we have the second option &#8211; which is the
hardware reset. It&#8217;s useful when your Raspberry Pi hangs a lot &#8211; but if it
does, then that game is probably not intended to be played in your Raspberry
Pi. But we&#8217;re giving you the option by the way. You have to keep in mind that
Option 2 is only a slightly better version of unplugging and plugging the power
source to your pi, which means it&#8217;s still a little risky for your SD card.</p>



<h3>Step 1 (Skip when opting to Option 1)</h3>



<ol><li>Solder the 2 male GPIO header to the P6 headers (labeled RUN) on your Raspberry Pi 3 board.<br>      <br>      </li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38.png" alt="" class="wp-image-181" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38.png 600w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38-300x300.png 300w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Step 2</h3>



<ol><li>Insert the 2 male to female USB extender to your Raspberry Pi 3. Mount the other end of the extender to the USB slot in the case. Attach the heat sink to the Pi&#8217;s CPU.</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-182" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39.png 600w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39-300x300.png 300w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p><br> 2.  Without the Micro SD card inserted, screw your Raspberry Pi 3 at the 3 screw points at the bottom of Rasptendo Case (see illustration below)  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-183" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40.png 600w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40-300x300.png 300w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Step 3</h3>



<ol><li>Connect the other end of <strong>POWER SW</strong> jumper wires to the pins in the PCB labeled <strong>POWER</strong>. Connect the other ends at Pins 5 (GPIO3) and 6 (GND).</li><li>Connect the <strong>RESET SW</strong> jumper wires to the pins in the PCB labeled <strong>RESET</strong>.<br>      <em>Option 1.</em> (<em>NO SOLDER</em>) Connect the other ends to Pins 13 (GPIO27) and 14 (GND).<br>      <em>Option 2.</em> Connect the other ends to the P6 headers (the ones you soldered labeled <strong>RUN</strong>)</li><li>Connect the <strong>POWER LED+</strong> jumper wire in the PCB labeled <strong>LED+</strong>. Connect the other end in Pin 8 (GPIO14).</li><li>Connect the <strong>POWER LED-</strong> jumper wire in the PCB labeled <strong>LED-</strong>. Connect the other end in Pin 9 (GND).</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="418" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-184" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-41.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-41-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p>5.  Screw the top component of the <strong>Rasptendo Case</strong> to its base.</p>



<h3>Step 4</h3>



<ol><li>Insert your Micro SD Card in your laptop, then download the image of RetroPie in <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">https://retropie.org.uk/download/</a>. Make sure to download the Raspberry Pi 2/3 version since you are going to install it on your Raspberry Pi 3.</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="183" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-186" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-43.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-43-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p>2. After downloading the <strong>.gz</strong> file, extract the file using your favorite extraction tool. Remember the directory where you extracted the <strong>.img</strong> file.</p>



<p>3. Download the <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a> software and install it.Click <strong>Select image</strong> then navigate to the extracted <strong>.img</strong> file. Click <strong>Select drive</strong> then choose the SD card. Click <strong>Flash!</strong> then wait for the process to finish.</p>



<h3>Step 5</h3>



<p>Now that you have assembled your Rasptendo game console, it&#8217;s time to install and configure some files for the <strong>POWER</strong> and <strong>RESET</strong> buttons to work. Fortunately, you can do this online with a one-line install using and bash in the Terminal.<br> 1. Connect your Rasptendo console to a monitor and a keyboard before powering your Raspberry Pi.<br> 2. Connect your Rasptendo to the internet. You may access the internet via <strong>LAN</strong> or via <strong>WiFi</strong>. (To configure your WiFi via Terminal follow this <a href="https://www.argon40.com.br/resources/how-to-enable-your-raspberry-pi-3-wifi-via-terminal/">tutorial</a>.)<br> 3. Access the <strong>Terminal</strong>&nbsp;of your RetroPie by pressing <strong>F4</strong> upon boot up.</p>



<p>In the Terminal, type the following command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Argon40Tech/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch/master/install.sh" | sudo bash</code></pre>



<p>This will run a command that will automatically configure your Raspberry Pi
3 to access the Rasptendo Console POWER button. Your Raspberry Pi will
automatically reboot in order for the changes to take place.</p>



<h3>Step 6</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="300" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-44.png" alt="" class="wp-image-187" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-44.png 400w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-44-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>After your Raspberry Pi has rebooted, test the Power button by holding it for a second. The LED will start blinking followed by your Raspberry Pi shutting down. You can turn on your pi by pressing the Power button again.<br> </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="228" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-48.png" alt="" class="wp-image-191" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-48.png 619w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-48-300x111.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="628" height="195" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-49.png" alt="" class="wp-image-192" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-49.png 628w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-49-300x93.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></figure></div>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="227" height="660" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-170" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-31.png 227w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-31-103x300.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></figure></div>



<p>GPIOs (General-Purpose Input/Output) are generic pins controllable by a user in execution time. You can program these pins to interact with the real world—from turning an LED on and off to commanding microcontrollers such as the Arduino. In short, GPIO enables you to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing">physical computing</a>. Raspberry Pi single-board computers have their own set of GPIO headers, but this article is going to focus on the 40-pin connector of the newer models: <strong>Raspberry Pi 3</strong> and <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero W</strong>.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by looking at the figure on the left. You can see that the pins are color-coded.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="50" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-32.png" alt="" class="wp-image-171"/></figure></div>



<p>These pins, when used with other peripheral devices such as servos, relays,
sensors etc., make a powerful tool for controlling the outside world. They will
help you become the <em>&#8220;MASTER&#8221;</em> of physical computing, like
turning on/off that lamp a few feet away from you.</p>



<h6>POWER Pins</h6>



<p>POWER Pins pull power directly from the Raspberry Pi. You can use them to
power other devices connected to your Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>To put it out there, the 5V pins (Pins 2 and 4) are directly connected to
the <code>5V0</code> rail (power supply) <sup><a href="#note2">1</a></sup>. This means that you
can, <em>in theory</em>, power the raspberry pi via one of these pins. But of
course that&#8217;s all in theory where everything is round, and frictionless, <code>pV = nRT</code> etc., powering the raspberry pi
here also means that your raspberry pi is unprotected and prone voltage and
current surges. If you are really that desperate to power you raspberry pi with
this method, try reading this <a href="http://www.raspberry-pi-geek.com/Archive/2013/01/Adding-an-On-Off-switch-to-your-Raspberry-Pi/">tutorial</a>
on how to make a full on power switch via the GPIO.</p>



<h6>GROUND Pins</h6>



<p>GROUND are the pins you use to ground your devices. It doesn’t matter which
pin you use as they are all connected to the same line.</p>



<h6>GPIO Pins</h6>



<p>GPIO Pins (General Purpose Input/Output) are the standard pins used to turn
devices on and off. Think of them as switches that you can program to turn on
or off depending on your set conditions. They can also be used as buttons if
you program them to &#8220;signal&#8221; you when they are shorted to ground. You
can do these things via the RPi.GPIO or GPIOZero modules in Python.</p>



<p>We recommend the GPIOZero for its simplicity and <em>zero boilerplate
philosophy</em> (which means you can focus on the logic of your programs rather
than on the lines of code you don&#8217;t need to understand anyway). GPIOZero also
makes programming buttons and LEDs easier to implement since this magnificent
module already takes care of all the boilerplate codes. In addition to that,
they also have very good <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>.</p>



<h3>Interfaces</h3>



<p>When talking about physical computing, you can&#8217;t leave out sensors and
microcontrollers. If your set up is a body, your Raspberry Pi is the brain
(&#8220;master&#8221;) and these peripherals like sensors and microcontrollers
(&#8220;slaves&#8221;) are your eyes, nose, skin, arms, feet, etc. There are a
lot of things that you can do with your Raspberry Pi alone, but there are
instances you need special devices that can detect temperature, and pressure.
Sometimes, you will even opt to avail microcontrollers. The following pins are
your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s way of communicating with these devices.</p>



<h6>UART Pins</h6>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the classic UART (Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter). Serial communication is the process of sending data one
bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus.</p>



<p>In Raspbian, the UART is, by default, used as connection for Raspbian&#8217;s
terminal. This is particularly useful if you want to access your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s
terminal on a PC but can&#8217;t connect via SSH (<em>e.g.</em> you don&#8217;t have
network/internet connection). You can follow this <a href="http://workshop.raspberrypiaustralia.com/usb/ttl/connecting/2014/08/31/01-connecting-to-raspberry-pi-via-usb/">tutorial</a>
to access your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s terminal using your pc. Of course, the UART is not
limited to this application. For <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Connect-the-Raspberry-Pi-to-network-using-UART/">example</a>:
you can use these pins to connect to a network by plugging it in a PC connected
to the internet.</p>



<p>The default baud rate (bits per second) of the Raspberry Pi is 115200. That
means the UART can pass data 115200 bits per second or, for all of you math
geniuses out there, 115.2 kbps. It might be a little slow, but it&#8217;s fast enough
for most of your projects. You can try to overclock (which means editing the
maximum baud rate) this limitation but it may lead to poor data integrity.
Also, you can also only control one UART device when using the Raspberry Pi&#8217;s
GPIO header. You need one connection for transmitting and one connection for
receiving data (which means a total of two connections for each device). Pin eight
(8) is for transmitting while Pin ten (10) is for receiving data. Since the
Raspberry Pi only has these two, it means you can only control one UART device.
Shift to the SPI or I2C enabled devices if you need more.</p>



<h6>SPI Pins</h6>



<p>SPI or Serial Peripheral Interface is another interface that allows multiple
control of slaves as long as you have multiple chip select connections. With
respect to Raspberry Pi&#8217;s GPIO header &#8211; by &#8220;multiple&#8221;, <em>I mean
two.</em> The minimum number of connections needed for a single SPI device is
four &#8211; 3 connections for the transferring, receiving, and synchronizing data,
and 1 connection for identification when controlling multiple devices. This
single connection is called the Chip Select and Raspberry Pi has currently 2
Chip Select pins, pins 24 and 26. That means you can only use at max 2 SPI
devices at the same time using your Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>In terms of speed, the SPI has the fastest speed compared with the other two
interfaces (UART and I2C) in exchange for some extra wires. Again, it all
depends on what device and purpose you want to install with your Raspberry Pi.</p>



<h6>I2C Pins</h6>



<p>I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit allows for multi-slave control using your
Raspberry Pi. It only uses 2 connections, (pins 3 and 5 in Raspberry Pi 3) to
control multiple slaves. You may prematurely say, &#8220;<em>hey, this is the
best choice to control multiple slaves so I should buy peripherals that uses
I2C!</em>&#8220;. However, it is only good for lower-speed peripherals so if you
need a faster communication between your Raspberry Pi 3 and your chosen sensor,
you may want to use the SPI enabled peripherals instead.</p>



<p>It is also appropriate to note that when the Raspberry Pi 3 is in <code>halt</code> or <code>shutdown</code> mode, you can &#8220;wake&#8221; it up by shorting
pin 5 to ground.</p>



<h6>EEPROM Pins</h6>



<p>These pins are reserved for I2C communication with an EEPROM (electrically
erasable programmable read-only memory) which means you can not use them. From
the <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/50348/what-are-the-id-eeprom-pins-and-what-can-they-be-used-for">raspberry
pi stack exchange</a>, EEPROM should only be used to communicate
with a HAT&#8217;s EEPROM. It lets Linux to automatically install required drivers
for the HAT to function. In other words, just don&#8217;t connect anything here.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the GPIO header of your Raspberry Pi enables you to act as
control peripherals, act like buttons, or automated switches. Depending on your
use case, you may use different interfaces to fully maximize the capacity of
your Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>RetroPie is an emulator for the Raspberry Pi that lets you play your
favorite childhood games. This includes games on platforms such as SNES, NES,
Atari, etc. You can install it on top of an existing Raspbian OS or readily
install it on your SD card with the RetroPie image.</p>



<p>This tutorial will teach you how to install RetroPie on your SD card for
your Raspberry Pi 3.</p>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Download the image</h3>



<p>Go to:<br><br>https://retropie.org.uk/download/</p>



<p>and make sure to download the Raspberry Pi 2/3 version since you are going
to install it on your Raspberry Pi 3.</p>



<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Extract the file</h3>



<p>After downloading the <strong>.gz</strong> file, extract the file using your
preferred extraction tool. Remember the directory you extracted the <strong>.img</strong>
file from.</p>



<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Burn the image</h3>



<p>There are several ways to do this but we recommend that you use <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a>. It’s fast and utilizes a simple interface that makes burning images on SD cards a breeze.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="318" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-15.png" alt="" class="wp-image-142" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-15.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-15-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>Navigate to the extracted <strong>.img</strong> file and choose the SD card
where you want to install RetroPie on and click <strong>Flash!</strong> You are
now ready for your first RetroPie boot up! </p>



<h3>Setting up your first game</h3>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve installed RetroPie, it&#8217;s time to play some games! First, you need to configure your gamepad and install your chosen game ROMs. Remember to download only the ROM&#8217;s of games that you already own. We don’t endorse piracy!</p>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Configure your gamepad controller</h3>



<p>Connect your gamepad controller via USB. RetroPie will automatically detect your gamepad.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="351" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-17.png" alt="" class="wp-image-146" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-17.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-17-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p><br> Do as the instruction says and hold any button to start configuring your controller. To configure the controller, press the controller button you would like to correspond to the button in the highlighted field.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="351" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-18.png" alt="" class="wp-image-147" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-18.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-18-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gamepad_config_2.png"></a></p>



<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Transferring ROMs</h3>



<p>ROMs (Read Only Memory) are the electronic versions of your old game
cartridges. There are currently three main methods of transferring your game
ROMs: via USB, via SFTP, and via Windows Samba Shares.</p>



<h6>via USB</h6>



<ol><li>Make sure your USB is formatted to FAT32.</li><li>Create a retropie folder in your flash drive.</li><li>Plug the USB into your Raspberry Pi 3, wait for 10
     seconds, and pull it out.</li><li>Plug your flash drive into you computer again. You&#8217;ll
     see that the retropie folder has been populated by 3 subfolders. Copy your
     ROMs to the roms/$CONSOLE subfolder. (e.g. put your Super Mario World game ROM
     in roms/snes).</li><li>Plug the USB into your Raspberry Pi 3 again and wait
     for another 10 seconds.</li><li>Choose quit from the start menu.</li></ol>



<h6>via SFTP</h6>



<ol><li>Connect to
     the WiFi using your Raspberry Pi 3 (follow this <a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/how-to-enable-your-raspberry-pi-3-wifi-via-terminal/">guide</a>
     if you are having any trouble connecting).</li><li>Download <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a> for Windows, or <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en">Cyberduck</a> for Mac. Follow these
     connection settings:</li></ol>



<p>* <strong>Protocol</strong>: <code>SFTP</code><br>
* <strong>IP Address</strong>: your RetroPie&#8217;s IP address (if you&#8217;re having any
trouble finding your IP Address, follow this guide <a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/how-to-enable-ssh-in-your-raspberry-pi-3/">here</a>).<br>
* <strong>Username</strong>: <code>pi</code><br>
* <strong>Password</strong>: <code>raspberry</code><br>
3. Drop the files into the ~RetroPie/roms/$CONSOLE folder where $CONSOLE is the
corresponding console the ROM should be played.</p>



<h6>via Samba Shares</h6>



<ol><li>You can
     access Samba Shares depending on your OS</li></ol>



<p>* On Windows, type <code>\\RETROPIE</code>
in your computer folder<br>
* On Mac, open finder, select &#8220;Go&#8221;, &#8220;Connect to Server&#8221;,
input <code>smb://retropie</code> and hit
&#8220;Connect&#8221;.<br>
2. Drop the files in the ~RetroPie/roms/$CONSOLE folder where $CONSOLE corresponds
to the console the ROM will be played on.</p>



<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Play!</h3>



<p>You will see something like this, depending on your transferred ROM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want to perform software updates to your latest Raspberry Pi 3
project without dismantling its current setup? Or do you just want to access
your Raspberry Pi but don&#8217;t have a dedicated monitor and keyboard for your
project? This can all be done via the <strong>SSH protocol,</strong> a
built-in feature in all Raspberry Pis with a Raspbian OS.</p>



<p>As you already know, the <strong>Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero and
Raspberry Pi Zero W</strong> are nifty single-board computers capable of
many DIY projects and applications. Most of these projects run <strong>&#8220;headless&#8221;</strong>
(which means that there is no graphical display, monitor, and peripheral
devices connected to your Pi). Commonly, you access and administer your
Raspberry Pi via <strong>VNC </strong><em>(Virtual
Network Computing)</em> or<strong> SSH—</strong>both of which
are available and pre-installed in your Raspbian.</p>



<p>The <strong>SSH protocol</strong> (also referred to as <em>Secure
Shell</em>) is a method for secure, remote login from one computer to
another. It provides several alternative options for strong authentication and
protects communications security and integrity with strong encryption. It is a
secure alternative to the unprotected login protocols, such as&nbsp;rlogin and
telnet, and insecure file transfer methods such as FTP.</p>



<p>This tutorial will guide you in accessing your Raspberry Pi 3 via SSH.</p>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Know your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s IP address</h3>



<p>If you have access to the graphical user interface via a monitor connected
to your Raspberry Pi, you can find this by typing the command below</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ ifconfig</code></pre>



<p>into the terminal software.</p>



<p>Your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s IP address is</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="592" height="141" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-5.png 592w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-5-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6.png"></a></p>



<p><strong>Special OPTION: Linux Only</strong></p>



<p>In case you’re already running headless at this point, you can find the IP
addresses of the devices connected to the same network as you by installing <code><strong>nmap</strong></code> <strong>(Linux only)</strong>.</p>



<p>After installing <code><strong>nmap</strong></code>,
type in the terminal:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24</code></pre>



<p>wherein <code><strong>192.168.1.0</strong></code>
is your router&#8217;s IP address. This may vary depending on how many networks you
have. If somehow the command fails, try changing <code><strong>192.168.1.0</strong></code> to <code><strong>192.168.2.0</strong></code> and so on.</p>



<p>Your pi&#8217;s IP address is:<br> </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="476" height="55" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-6.png 476w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-6-300x35.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/8.png"></a></p>



<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Enable SSH on your Raspberry Pi</h3>



<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>SSH</strong> option is <em>&#8220;disabled&#8221;</em>
by default in your Raspberry Pi. To enable SSH, you just have to create a file
named <code><strong>ssh</strong></code> in the boot
partition of your SD card. The content of the file does not matter. Take note
that it has no suffix.</p>



<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>



<p>If you have access to a graphical user interface, you can <strong>enable
it using the terminal</strong>. Type,</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ sudo raspi-config</code></pre>



<ol><li>Select <code><strong>Interfacing Options</strong></code></li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="561" height="317" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-134" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-9.png 561w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-9-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></figure></div>



<p><br>      <a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1.png"></a></p>



<p>2. Select <code><strong>SSH</strong></code></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="561" height="319" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-135" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-10.png 561w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-10-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></figure></div>



<p><br>      <a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2.png"></a></p>



<p>3. Choose <strong>&#8221;Yes”</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="565" height="319" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-7.png 565w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-7-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></figure></div>



<p>4. Select <strong>&#8221;Ok”</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="574" height="325" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-133" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-8.png 574w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-8-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></figure></div>



<p><br>      <a href="http://www.argon40.com.br/resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/4.png"></a></p>



<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Setup your Client (Mac, Linux, and Windows)</h3>



<p>Accessing your Raspberry Pi on your PC via SSH depends on your PC&#8217;s operating
system. Linux and Mac OS have SSH natively built into their system, but Windows
requires you to install third-party SSH clients.</p>



<p>You will be prompted for a password for your Raspberry pi: the default
password is &#8220;<strong>raspberry</strong>&#8221; and
default user is &#8220;<strong>pi</strong>&#8221; for the first
time it’s launched. We recommend that you change the default password.</p>



<h6>Linux and Mac</h6>



<p>For Linux and Mac, just type,</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ ssh pi@192.168.2.109</code></pre>



<p>wherein &#8220;192.168.2.109&#8221; is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. Just
change the IP address to your own and you’ll be ready to login to your pi using
SSH!</p>



<h6>Windows</h6>



<p>You will need to install a third-party SSH client in order to use SSH on
Windows. For this tutorial, we are going to use puTTY. You can download
putty.exe for basic SSH <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">here</a>.</p>



<ol><li>Double-click      on the putty.exe program.</li><li>Enter the necessary      settings</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="450" height="439" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-136" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-11.png 450w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-11-300x293.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></figure></div>



<p>* ip address<br> * port<br> * connection type<br> 3. Click <code><strong>Open</strong></code> to start session.<br> 4. Accept the connection<br> 5. Input username and password</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="515" height="326" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-137" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-12.png 515w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-12-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /></figure></div>
