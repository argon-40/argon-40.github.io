<p>The RASPTENDO Retro Gaming Case is
currently the slickest enclosure for your Raspberry Pi 3. The SNES inspired
design brings back the fun and nostalgia of the roaring sounds of 90&#8217;s and the quintessential
images of the 16-bit graphics of the time.</p>



<p>When installed with a game emulator, like Retropie, your Raspberry Pi 3 with the RASPTENDO Retro gaming case becomes a display-worthy SNES inspired console for any living room or game room.</p>



<p>The RASPTENDO Case resolves the
common issues when turning your Raspberry Pi 3 into a game or entertainment
console. Primarily most cases out there are straight out ugly. The RASPTENDO
case brings in the nostalgic flair to a barebones Raspberry Pi 3.</p>



<p>Personally, I never liked the placement of the HDMI and power sockets when fitted with most of the cases on the market. Everything seems unnatural especially when you need to access the USB port and LAN port. You know what I mean when you have used your Raspberry Pi long enough.</p>



<p>The RASPTENDO Case form factor basically not only makes your Raspberry Pi visually appealing but functionally better. The following design consideration and features allows for better user experience for the Raspberry Pi 3 either as a game console or entertainment system – and maybe even as a regular Linux computer on your desktop.</p>



<p>The Rasptendo Case provides for the
following:</p>



<ul><li>Rear access to HDMI and power cables</li><li>Functional POWER and RESET Buttons</li><li>Front USB Access</li><li>Easy access to micro SD card</li></ul>



<p>For more information, you can visit <a href="https://rasptendo.com">https://rasptendo.com</a></p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="227" height="660" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-170" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-31.png 227w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-31-103x300.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></figure></div>



<p>GPIOs (General-Purpose Input/Output) are generic pins controllable by a user in execution time. You can program these pins to interact with the real world—from turning an LED on and off to commanding microcontrollers such as the Arduino. In short, GPIO enables you to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing">physical computing</a>. Raspberry Pi single-board computers have their own set of GPIO headers, but this article is going to focus on the 40-pin connector of the newer models: <strong>Raspberry Pi 3</strong> and <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero W</strong>.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by looking at the figure on the left. You can see that the pins are color-coded.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="50" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-32.png" alt="" class="wp-image-171"/></figure></div>



<p>These pins, when used with other peripheral devices such as servos, relays,
sensors etc., make a powerful tool for controlling the outside world. They will
help you become the <em>&#8220;MASTER&#8221;</em> of physical computing, like
turning on/off that lamp a few feet away from you.</p>



<h6>POWER Pins</h6>



<p>POWER Pins pull power directly from the Raspberry Pi. You can use them to
power other devices connected to your Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>To put it out there, the 5V pins (Pins 2 and 4) are directly connected to
the <code>5V0</code> rail (power supply) <sup><a href="#note2">1</a></sup>. This means that you
can, <em>in theory</em>, power the raspberry pi via one of these pins. But of
course that&#8217;s all in theory where everything is round, and frictionless, <code>pV = nRT</code> etc., powering the raspberry pi
here also means that your raspberry pi is unprotected and prone voltage and
current surges. If you are really that desperate to power you raspberry pi with
this method, try reading this <a href="http://www.raspberry-pi-geek.com/Archive/2013/01/Adding-an-On-Off-switch-to-your-Raspberry-Pi/">tutorial</a>
on how to make a full on power switch via the GPIO.</p>



<h6>GROUND Pins</h6>



<p>GROUND are the pins you use to ground your devices. It doesn’t matter which
pin you use as they are all connected to the same line.</p>



<h6>GPIO Pins</h6>



<p>GPIO Pins (General Purpose Input/Output) are the standard pins used to turn
devices on and off. Think of them as switches that you can program to turn on
or off depending on your set conditions. They can also be used as buttons if
you program them to &#8220;signal&#8221; you when they are shorted to ground. You
can do these things via the RPi.GPIO or GPIOZero modules in Python.</p>



<p>We recommend the GPIOZero for its simplicity and <em>zero boilerplate
philosophy</em> (which means you can focus on the logic of your programs rather
than on the lines of code you don&#8217;t need to understand anyway). GPIOZero also
makes programming buttons and LEDs easier to implement since this magnificent
module already takes care of all the boilerplate codes. In addition to that,
they also have very good <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>.</p>



<h3>Interfaces</h3>



<p>When talking about physical computing, you can&#8217;t leave out sensors and
microcontrollers. If your set up is a body, your Raspberry Pi is the brain
(&#8220;master&#8221;) and these peripherals like sensors and microcontrollers
(&#8220;slaves&#8221;) are your eyes, nose, skin, arms, feet, etc. There are a
lot of things that you can do with your Raspberry Pi alone, but there are
instances you need special devices that can detect temperature, and pressure.
Sometimes, you will even opt to avail microcontrollers. The following pins are
your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s way of communicating with these devices.</p>



<h6>UART Pins</h6>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the classic UART (Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter). Serial communication is the process of sending data one
bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus.</p>



<p>In Raspbian, the UART is, by default, used as connection for Raspbian&#8217;s
terminal. This is particularly useful if you want to access your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s
terminal on a PC but can&#8217;t connect via SSH (<em>e.g.</em> you don&#8217;t have
network/internet connection). You can follow this <a href="http://workshop.raspberrypiaustralia.com/usb/ttl/connecting/2014/08/31/01-connecting-to-raspberry-pi-via-usb/">tutorial</a>
to access your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s terminal using your pc. Of course, the UART is not
limited to this application. For <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Connect-the-Raspberry-Pi-to-network-using-UART/">example</a>:
you can use these pins to connect to a network by plugging it in a PC connected
to the internet.</p>



<p>The default baud rate (bits per second) of the Raspberry Pi is 115200. That
means the UART can pass data 115200 bits per second or, for all of you math
geniuses out there, 115.2 kbps. It might be a little slow, but it&#8217;s fast enough
for most of your projects. You can try to overclock (which means editing the
maximum baud rate) this limitation but it may lead to poor data integrity.
Also, you can also only control one UART device when using the Raspberry Pi&#8217;s
GPIO header. You need one connection for transmitting and one connection for
receiving data (which means a total of two connections for each device). Pin eight
(8) is for transmitting while Pin ten (10) is for receiving data. Since the
Raspberry Pi only has these two, it means you can only control one UART device.
Shift to the SPI or I2C enabled devices if you need more.</p>



<h6>SPI Pins</h6>



<p>SPI or Serial Peripheral Interface is another interface that allows multiple
control of slaves as long as you have multiple chip select connections. With
respect to Raspberry Pi&#8217;s GPIO header &#8211; by &#8220;multiple&#8221;, <em>I mean
two.</em> The minimum number of connections needed for a single SPI device is
four &#8211; 3 connections for the transferring, receiving, and synchronizing data,
and 1 connection for identification when controlling multiple devices. This
single connection is called the Chip Select and Raspberry Pi has currently 2
Chip Select pins, pins 24 and 26. That means you can only use at max 2 SPI
devices at the same time using your Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>In terms of speed, the SPI has the fastest speed compared with the other two
interfaces (UART and I2C) in exchange for some extra wires. Again, it all
depends on what device and purpose you want to install with your Raspberry Pi.</p>



<h6>I2C Pins</h6>



<p>I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit allows for multi-slave control using your
Raspberry Pi. It only uses 2 connections, (pins 3 and 5 in Raspberry Pi 3) to
control multiple slaves. You may prematurely say, &#8220;<em>hey, this is the
best choice to control multiple slaves so I should buy peripherals that uses
I2C!</em>&#8220;. However, it is only good for lower-speed peripherals so if you
need a faster communication between your Raspberry Pi 3 and your chosen sensor,
you may want to use the SPI enabled peripherals instead.</p>



<p>It is also appropriate to note that when the Raspberry Pi 3 is in <code>halt</code> or <code>shutdown</code> mode, you can &#8220;wake&#8221; it up by shorting
pin 5 to ground.</p>



<h6>EEPROM Pins</h6>



<p>These pins are reserved for I2C communication with an EEPROM (electrically
erasable programmable read-only memory) which means you can not use them. From
the <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/50348/what-are-the-id-eeprom-pins-and-what-can-they-be-used-for">raspberry
pi stack exchange</a>, EEPROM should only be used to communicate
with a HAT&#8217;s EEPROM. It lets Linux to automatically install required drivers
for the HAT to function. In other words, just don&#8217;t connect anything here.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the GPIO header of your Raspberry Pi enables you to act as
control peripherals, act like buttons, or automated switches. Depending on your
use case, you may use different interfaces to fully maximize the capacity of
your Raspberry Pi.</p>
