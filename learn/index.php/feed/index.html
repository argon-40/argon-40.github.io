<p>One of the simplest classic projects a maker can spend their time on is building a robot buggy with the Raspberry Pi. If somebody told me I could build robots with the Raspberry Pi, I would have gotten into it sooner! This article will show you how you can build a robot buggy and program it to move around under your control with simple Python commands!</p>



<p>Materials needed:</p>



<ul><li>Raspberry Pi 3</li><li>Motor controller board</li><li>2 × 3V &#8211; 6V DC motors</li><li>2 × wheels</li><li>1 × AA battery holder (for 4 AA batteries)</li><li>4 × AA batteries</li><li>Ball caster</li><li>Wire or jumper leads</li><li>A USB Battery pack</li><li>Screwdriver</li><li>Soldering iron and solder</li><li>Wire strippers</li><li>Small cardboard or plastic box and glue/tape</li></ul>



<p>Optional materials:</p>



<ul><li>Breadboard</li><li>VL53L0X time-of-flight range finder or ultrasonic distance sensor</li><li>2 × line following sensors</li><li>18650 battery, battery clip, USB charge/discharge board (or USB power bank)</li></ul>



<p>Software:</p>



<ul><li>The latest version of Raspbian</li></ul>



<p>Additional Extras:</p>



<ul><li>Small cardboard box</li><li>Adhesives (duct tape/putty/glue)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Assembling your motors and board</strong></p>



<p>The first step to building your robot buggy pi is connecting the motor controller to the Raspberry Pi, the battery pack, and your two motors. This will test if your components are all working properly. For this project, we will be using the L298N Dual H Bridge DC Stepper Motor Driver Controller board. Don’t worry if you don’t have the exact model that will be used in this article, because these instructions will be applicable to most motor controller boards. You can check your board’s documentation if you are using a different model.</p>



<p><strong>Soldering wires to your motors</strong></p>



<p>If you have managed to buy motors that have wires, you can skip this part! However, most motors on the market do not have wires attached to them so you will need to solder them on yourself.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Strip the ends of your wires to reveal the metal core</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/strip-wire.jpg" alt="strip wires"/></figure>



<ul><li>For easier soldering, take the plastic clip off from your motor (you can use a screwdriver for this).</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/motor-remove-clip.jpg" alt="remove clip"/></figure>



<ul><li>Solder your wires to the terminals of your motor and reattach the plastic clips you removed earlier.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/solder-motor.gif" alt="solder wires"/></figure>



<ul><li>In order to ensure that the wires do not touch the motor’s metal casing, trim them off. You may also wrap the ends of your motors with tape for durability.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Connecting the Motors to the Board</strong></p>



<p>Ready your small screwdriver to connect your motors to your board.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Proceed to loosen the screws in terminal blocks OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, and OUT4. If your terminal blocks are labeled differently, consult the documentation for your board.</li><li>Strip the ends of the wires and insert the stripped ends into the terminal blocks. If needed, you may cut off the male/female ends.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/wires-in-board.jpg" alt="inserted wires"/></figure>



<ul><li>Tighten the screws to the terminal blocks to ensure that the wires stay in place.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/wire-in-block.jpg" alt="terminal block"/></figure>



<p><strong>Powering the Motors</strong></p>



<p>The raspberry Pi alone will not be able to supply enough power for your motors. This is where your AA batteries come in!</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Grab your screwdriver and loosen the screws for terminal blocks VCC, GND, and 5V.</li><li>With your AA battery holder in-hand, insert the red wire into terminal block VCC and the black wire into terminal block GND (these are not interchangeable).</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/battery-holder.jpg" alt="battery holder"/></figure>



<ul><li>Once again, tighten the screws to ensure that your wires stay in place.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/battery-terminals.jpg" alt="battery terminals"/></figure>



<p><strong>Connecting the Board to your Raspberry Pi</strong></p>



<p>You will need to wire the board to the Raspberry Pi for this project to work. There are boards that will require you to follow a different procedure for connecting, and there are boards that act as a hat that you can simply place onto the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. You may check your board’s documentation if you are not using a different board than the one being used in this article.</p>



<p>For our board, we will be utilizing pins labeled In1, In2, In3, and In4 as well as the two GND pins. The GPIO pins that you will be using on your Raspberry Pi is completely up to you! In this article, we will be using GPIO 7, 8, 9, and 10.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Grab the five female-to-female jumper leads and connect your preferred Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the motor controller board pins. If the board you’re using does not have a GND pin, you may strip the end of a female-to-female and insert it into terminal block GND that supplies your battery pack. Make sure it’s secure!</li></ol>



<p>The connections are as follows:</p>



<p>7 – In1</p>



<p>8 – In2</p>



<p>9 – In3</p>



<p>10 – In4</p>



<p>GND – GND</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/gpio-board.jpg" alt="GPIO to board"/></figure>



<p><strong>Configuring Directions</strong></p>



<p>It is time to assign a direction to your motors! To configure your left and right motors, you will need to know which way they go forward and which way they go backwards.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Pick one of your motors and use a marker pen to label it ‘right.’ You will want to draw an arrow to configure which way it will go forward. Repeat this process with your other motor but label it ‘left.’</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/motors_labelled.jpg" alt="labeled motors"/></figure>



<ul><li>Open <strong>mu</strong> (this can be found in the Raspberry Pi programming menu), and type</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">from gpiozero import Robot
robby = Robot(left=(7,8), right=(9,10))</pre>



<p><br>in order to import the Robot class and create a Robot project. ‘Robby’ stands for the robot’s name, but you can name it whatever you want to name it!</p>



<ul><li>Save the file as ‘robby.py’ or whatever you decided to name your robot.</li><li>Click <strong>Run</strong>!</li><li>Now open a python shell (do this by clicking the terminal icon located in the taskbar, which is at the top of the screen), type ‘python,’ and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">robby.forward()</pre>



<p>to find out which way the motors turn. If you wish to stop them, type</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">robot.stop()</pre>



<ul><li>This next step will allow you to determine which motor is left and right. Type</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">robby.forward(0.4)<br>robby.right(0.4)</pre>



<p> to do this (the 0.4 will make the motor go slower than usual, and make      it easier for you to see which way they turn). The motor that changes direction is the right-hand motor.</p>



<ul><li>If you guessed correctly and right-hand motor is indeed the motor you labeled ‘right,’ then you do not have to changed anything. However, if the right-hand motor is the one you labeled ‘left,’ then you will need to change your Robot object in your file to swap the left and right pin numbers:</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">## e.g. change<br>robby = Robot(left=(7,8), right=(9,10))</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">## to<br>robby = Robot(left=(9,10), right=(7,8))</pre>



<ul><li>We will now proceed to check if you have the forward and backward movements set up correctly. Again, drive both of your motors forward with robby.forward(0.4) and check if both motors are turning as follows:</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/motor-test.gif" alt="direction of motors"/></figure>



<p>If the right-hand motor isn’t turning as shown, you will have make another change.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/motor_direction.png" alt=""/></figure>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">## e.g. change<br>robby = Robot(left=(9,10), right=(7,8))</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">## to<br>robby = Robot(left=(9,10), right=(8,7))</pre>



<p>If the left-hand motor is turning in the wrong direction, however, do the same but replace the right-hand pin numbers with the left-hand pin numbers.</p>



<p><strong>Assembling the robot</strong></p>



<p>Keep in mind that you do not have to follow these directions if you wish for your robot body to look differently. However, keep in mind that:</p>



<ul><li>The body needs to be big enough for the Raspberry Pi, the motor controller, and the batteries to fit into.</li><li>The body needs to be able to accommodate mounting the wheels.</li></ul>



<p>The Raspberry Pi website recommends that you build a prototype chassis first in order to grasp a feel of what an appropriate robot body is. You can then learn to make better bodies with laser-cutting or 3D printing! This article, however, will utilize a cardboard box for now.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Place your motors into the box, preferably arranged in the way you want them to stay in permanently. Mark where you want the motors’ axle to pass through—and make sure your wheels have enough room to spin around!</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-0.jpg" alt="chassis-1"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-1.jpg" alt="chassis-2"/></figure>



<ul><li>Poke holes through the sides of the box where you will fit the motors’ axles into.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-2.jpg" alt="chassis-3"/></figure>



<ul><li>To make sure the motors are held in place, use an adhesive putty or tape to secure them.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-3.jpg" alt="chassis-4"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-4.jpg" alt="chassis-5"/></figure>



<ul><li>When you are content with the motor placement, proceed to attach the wheels to the axles.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-5.jpg" alt="chassis-6"/></figure>



<ul><li>Once you have attached the wheels, you can screw a ball caster at the front section as a third wheel!</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-6.jpg" alt="chassis-7"/></figure>

<ul><li>You can use a power bank to power up your Raspberry Pi!</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/build-a-buggy/2919a77a9ddf6a074d94c87ab7bfa8fea0b12337/en/images/chassis-8.jpg" alt="chassis-8"/></figure>

<h4><strong>Assembly&nbsp;Instructions</strong> </h4>



<p>While the Argon ONE case was designed to be as simple and as accessible as
possible, there are some necessary steps that could be potentially missed and
ignored. This guide tries to be as comprehensive as possible to provide
additional details to help users understand our product better. </p>



<h3><strong>Step&nbsp;1:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Connect Raspberry Pi to HDMI-Audio Board through the <strong>HDMI and Audio Ports</strong> of the Pi. Make sure the board is pushed in as far as possible. This is how all the ports are kept on one side. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="186" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-53.png" alt="" class="wp-image-273" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-53.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-53-300x89.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Stick the thermal silicon pad (<strong>blue pad</strong>) on the square protrusion of the case. The <strong>thicker pad is for the 3 B model</strong> while the <strong>thinner pad is for the 3 B+ model</strong>. </li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="564" height="165" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-54.png" alt="" class="wp-image-274" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-54.png 564w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-54-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="191" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-55.png" alt="" class="wp-image-275" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-55.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-55-300x92.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>Step&nbsp;2:</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Carefully connect the <strong>Raspberry Pi GPIO</strong> to the power and cooling board. The pi is properly connected when the pi is even. This allows the power and cooling board to provide power to the Raspberry Pi.      </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="404" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-56.png" alt="" class="wp-image-276" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-56.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-56-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Step&nbsp;3:</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Use shorter <strong>flat head screws</strong> to fasten Raspberry Pi and HDMI-Audio Board assembly to top case, ensuring that the assembly is properly placed in. This is important to do because the board can be easily displaced, affecting the connection of the HDMI port. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="358" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-57.png" alt="" class="wp-image-277" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-57.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-57-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Step&nbsp;4:</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Use longer <strong>round&nbsp;head&nbsp;screws</strong> to fasten the bottom cover, making sure that the case is properly closed</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="532" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-58.png" alt="" class="wp-image-278" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-58.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-58-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Place rubber footings on the case. You can find the footings on the <strong>black&nbsp;pad</strong> that comes with the case. This prevents the case from slipping on smooth surfaces.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="289" height="261" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-59.png" alt="" class="wp-image-279"/></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Step&nbsp;5:</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Insert SD Card in the SD card slot. <strong>Never&nbsp;</strong>insert&nbsp;the&nbsp;SD&nbsp;card&nbsp;into&nbsp;the&nbsp;Pi&nbsp;before&nbsp;placing&nbsp;the&nbsp;case&#8217;s bottom. The bottom can apply potential on the SD card and potentially <strong>break&nbsp;the&nbsp;SD&nbsp;card</strong>. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="523" height="337" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-60.png" alt="" class="wp-image-280" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-60.png 523w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-60-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="518" height="397" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-61.png" alt="" class="wp-image-281" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-61.png 518w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-61-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></figure></div>



<p>Insert HDMI and power supply. This powers the pi and uses it as a computer. </p>



<h3><strong>How&nbsp;to&nbsp;install&nbsp;Argon&nbsp;ONE Power&nbsp;Button&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fan&nbsp;Control</strong></h3>



<p>One important thing to note when assembling the case is that the Power
Button and Fan do not instantly work properly upon assembly. For this guide, it
is important that you install the latest version of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspbian</a>, as it is one
of the OSes that can currently use the Fan, Power Button, and GPIO pins to
their full potential.</p>



<ul><li>Connect to the internet. You can do that by connecting an ethernet cable to the ethernet port or by using the wifi of the Raspberry Pi. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-62.png" alt="" class="wp-image-282" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-62.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-62-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Open <strong>Terminal</strong> in Raspbian. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-63.png" alt="" class="wp-image-283" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-63.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-63-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Type the text below in the <strong>Terminal </strong>to initiate the installation of Argon ONE script. If you&#8217;ve done this correctly, you should see the icons appear on your Raspbian desktop as a result of the installation. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="392" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-64.png" alt="" class="wp-image-284" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-64.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-64-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Once installed, the desktop should look like this:</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-65.png" alt="" class="wp-image-285" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-65.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-65-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Reboot the pi.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-66.png" alt="" class="wp-image-286" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-66.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-66-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Argon ONE Power Button Functions</strong></h3>



<p>The process above will automatically install the configuration that will
activate the Argon ONE Power Button with the following functions:</p>



<ul><li>Pressing the power button while the Pi is <strong>off</strong> will <strong>turn on</strong> the Pi.</li><li>Pressing the power button for <strong>at least 3 seconds while the Pi is on</strong> will <strong>safely shutdown</strong> the Pi and <strong>turn it off</strong>. This is indicated by the <strong>green LED blinking.</strong></li><li><strong>Pressing the power button for less than 3 seconds while the Pi is on will do nothing.</strong></li><li><strong>Pressing the power button twice while the Pi</strong> is on will <strong>reboot</strong> the Pi. This is indicated by the <strong>green LED</strong> blinking.</li><li>Pressing the power button for <strong>at least 5 seconds while the Pi is on</strong> will <strong>force shutdown</strong> the Pi. This is indicated by the <strong>sudden stopping</strong> of the Pi. </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="320" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-67.png" alt="" class="wp-image-287" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-67.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-67-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Argon&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;Fan&nbsp;Speed</strong></h3>



<p>Upon installation of the Argon ONE script by default, the settings of the
Argon ONE cooling system are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>When the CPU temperature is at <strong>55 C</strong>, the fan will run at <strong>10%</strong> of its maximum speed</li><li>When the CPU temperature is at <strong>60 C</strong>, the fan will run at <strong>55%</strong> of its maximum speed</li><li>When the CPU temperature is at <strong>65 C</strong>, the fan will run at <strong>100%</strong> of its maximum speed </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="194" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-68.png" alt="" class="wp-image-288" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-68.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-68-300x93.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p>However, you may change or configure the FAN to your desired settings by clicking the Argon ONE Config icon on your Desktop.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-69.png" alt="" class="wp-image-289" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-69.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-69-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>You may also configure the fan via <strong>Terminal</strong> by typing: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-70.png" alt="" class="wp-image-290" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-70.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-70-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>It is possible to customize when the fan changes temperature and what speed the fan runs at. To exit the menu, press Escape and Enter after that.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-71.png" alt="" class="wp-image-291" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-71.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-71-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-72.png" alt="" class="wp-image-292" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-72.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-72-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-73.png" alt="" class="wp-image-293" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-73.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-73-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p>To check if the fan is running, feel the top of the case. Any <strong>sound
</strong>from the fan will cause <strong>vibrations</strong>. If any
<strong>vibrations </strong>are felt, that means that the fan is <strong>running</strong>.</p>



<h3><strong>Uninstalling&nbsp;Argon&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;Script</strong></h3>



<p>To uninstall the Argon ONE script, you may do so by clicking the Argon ONE Uninstall icon on your Desktop.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="468" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-74.png" alt="" class="wp-image-294" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-74.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-74-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>

<p>Before this blog, the Rasptendo script worked only for RetroPie (arguably the most popular emulation OS for Raspberry Pi). Since a lot of you were asking for Recalbox support, we decided to create a script for it. But before we start, there are just a couple of things that you need to know about Recalbox.</p>



<p>The first thing about Recalbox is that it is created using <a href="https://buildroot.org/">Buildroot</a>, which makes it very minimal &#8211; which also makes it a little low with nice features such as the Debian&#8217;s* package management tool <strong>apt</strong>. The original script uses <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a>, a nice and easy Python module for controlling the GPIO. It is easily installed using <strong>apt</strong>. Since Recalbox doesn&#8217;t have this, this script won&#8217;t use the GPIOZero. The reason why we wanted to use GPIOZero instead of the &#8220;lower-level&#8221; RPi.GPIO module is that because we wanted you to &#8220;hack&#8221; your Rasptendo. You can see the Python script at /opt/Rasptendo/halt_wake.py in your RetroPie. Feel free to do some configuration but make sure you know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>Secondly, Recalbox&#8217;s support for GPIO3 as a power button doesn&#8217;t work the same as much as typical Raspberry Pi OS. It doesn&#8217;t allow holding which means it shuts down your Pi simultaneously once you press it. But enough of the talking&#8211;here&#8217;s your script for Recalbox. (Remember to connect your Recalbox to the internet)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wget --no-check-certificate -O - 
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Argon40Tech/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch/master/recalbox_install.sh" | bash</pre>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry if the script runs too
fast, it does what it does, but the script does not make use of GPIOZero (takes
a little time to download) in exchange for a little more complicated <a href="https://github.com/Argon40Tech/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch/blob/master/halt_wake_non_gpiozero.py">Python script</a>.</p>



<p>(<strong>*Note:</strong> Raspbian is
Debian-based and RetroPie is built on top of Raspbian which makes RetroPie a
&#8220;Debian-based operating system&#8221;)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The RASPTENDO Retro Gaming Case is
currently the slickest enclosure for your Raspberry Pi 3. The SNES inspired
design brings back the fun and nostalgia of the roaring sounds of 90&#8217;s and the quintessential
images of the 16-bit graphics of the time.</p>



<p>When installed with a game emulator, like Retropie, your Raspberry Pi 3 with the RASPTENDO Retro gaming case becomes a display-worthy SNES inspired console for any living room or game room.</p>



<p>The RASPTENDO Case resolves the
common issues when turning your Raspberry Pi 3 into a game or entertainment
console. Primarily most cases out there are straight out ugly. The RASPTENDO
case brings in the nostalgic flair to a barebones Raspberry Pi 3.</p>



<p>Personally, I never liked the placement of the HDMI and power sockets when fitted with most of the cases on the market. Everything seems unnatural especially when you need to access the USB port and LAN port. You know what I mean when you have used your Raspberry Pi long enough.</p>



<p>The RASPTENDO Case form factor basically not only makes your Raspberry Pi visually appealing but functionally better. The following design consideration and features allows for better user experience for the Raspberry Pi 3 either as a game console or entertainment system – and maybe even as a regular Linux computer on your desktop.</p>



<p>The Rasptendo Case provides for the
following:</p>



<ul><li>Rear access to HDMI and power cables</li><li>Functional POWER and RESET Buttons</li><li>Front USB Access</li><li>Easy access to micro SD card</li></ul>



<p>For more information, you can visit <a href="https://rasptendo.com">https://rasptendo.com</a></p>



<p>To buy the RASPTENDO Case follow the

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You now have your new <strong>Rasptendo Case</strong>. Now it’s
time for you to assemble and configure it along with your Raspberry Pi 3 to
transform it into the Rasptendo retro gaming console.</p>



<p>The Rasptendo Package Box comes with</p>



<ul><li>Rasptendo Case</li><li>2 male to female USB extender</li><li>POWER and RESET Button PCB Board</li><li>6 labeled female to female jumper wires</li><li>2 male GPIO header</li><li>Installation guide</li><li>heat sink</li></ul>



<p>The POWER button issues a safe shutdown command to your Raspberry Pi to
prevent damage to your SD card. For the RESET button, you can have two (2)
options &#8211; one for the soft reboot, and one for the hard reset.</p>



<p>Option 1 for the RESET button issues a soft reboot, which is the safe way
(for your SD Card) of rebooting. It&#8217;s the same as issuing a <code>sudo reboot</code> in the terminal. It&#8217;s
especially useful when you transfer ROMs via WiFi and you have to reboot for
the RetroPie to discover the newly transferred games. The minor downside to
this option is that if your Raspberry Pi hangs (which happens rarely), the
button won&#8217;t work. That is why we have the second option &#8211; which is the
hardware reset. It&#8217;s useful when your Raspberry Pi hangs a lot &#8211; but if it
does, then that game is probably not intended to be played in your Raspberry
Pi. But we&#8217;re giving you the option by the way. You have to keep in mind that
Option 2 is only a slightly better version of unplugging and plugging the power
source to your pi, which means it&#8217;s still a little risky for your SD card.</p>



<h3>Step 1 (Skip when opting to Option 1)</h3>



<ol><li>Solder the 2 male GPIO header to the P6 headers (labeled RUN) on your Raspberry Pi 3 board.<br>      <br>      </li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38.png" alt="" class="wp-image-181" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38.png 600w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38-300x300.png 300w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Step 2</h3>



<ol><li>Insert the 2 male to female USB extender to your Raspberry Pi 3. Mount the other end of the extender to the USB slot in the case. Attach the heat sink to the Pi&#8217;s CPU.</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-182" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39.png 600w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39-300x300.png 300w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p><br> 2.  Without the Micro SD card inserted, screw your Raspberry Pi 3 at the 3 screw points at the bottom of Rasptendo Case (see illustration below)  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-183" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40.png 600w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40-300x300.png 300w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Step 3</h3>



<ol><li>Connect the other end of <strong>POWER SW</strong> jumper wires to the pins in the PCB labeled <strong>POWER</strong>. Connect the other ends at Pins 5 (GPIO3) and 6 (GND).</li><li>Connect the <strong>RESET SW</strong> jumper wires to the pins in the PCB labeled <strong>RESET</strong>.<br>      <em>Option 1.</em> (<em>NO SOLDER</em>) Connect the other ends to Pins 13 (GPIO27) and 14 (GND).<br>      <em>Option 2.</em> Connect the other ends to the P6 headers (the ones you soldered labeled <strong>RUN</strong>)</li><li>Connect the <strong>POWER LED+</strong> jumper wire in the PCB labeled <strong>LED+</strong>. Connect the other end in Pin 8 (GPIO14).</li><li>Connect the <strong>POWER LED-</strong> jumper wire in the PCB labeled <strong>LED-</strong>. Connect the other end in Pin 9 (GND).</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="418" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-184" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-41.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-41-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p>5.  Screw the top component of the <strong>Rasptendo Case</strong> to its base.</p>



<h3>Step 4</h3>



<ol><li>Insert your Micro SD Card in your laptop, then download the image of RetroPie in <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">https://retropie.org.uk/download/</a>. Make sure to download the Raspberry Pi 2/3 version since you are going to install it on your Raspberry Pi 3.</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="183" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-186" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-43.png 624w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-43-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<p>2. After downloading the <strong>.gz</strong> file, extract the file using your favorite extraction tool. Remember the directory where you extracted the <strong>.img</strong> file.</p>



<p>3. Download the <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a> software and install it.Click <strong>Select image</strong> then navigate to the extracted <strong>.img</strong> file. Click <strong>Select drive</strong> then choose the SD card. Click <strong>Flash!</strong> then wait for the process to finish.</p>



<h3>Step 5</h3>



<p>Now that you have assembled your Rasptendo game console, it&#8217;s time to install and configure some files for the <strong>POWER</strong> and <strong>RESET</strong> buttons to work. Fortunately, you can do this online with a one-line install using and bash in the Terminal.<br> 1. Connect your Rasptendo console to a monitor and a keyboard before powering your Raspberry Pi.<br> 2. Connect your Rasptendo to the internet. You may access the internet via <strong>LAN</strong> or via <strong>WiFi</strong>. (To configure your WiFi via Terminal follow this <a href="https://www.argon40.com.br/resources/how-to-enable-your-raspberry-pi-3-wifi-via-terminal/">tutorial</a>.)<br> 3. Access the <strong>Terminal</strong>&nbsp;of your RetroPie by pressing <strong>F4</strong> upon boot up.</p>



<p>In the Terminal, type the following command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Argon40Tech/Super-Rasptendo-Case-Power-Switch/master/install.sh" | sudo bash</code></pre>



<p>This will run a command that will automatically configure your Raspberry Pi
3 to access the Rasptendo Console POWER button. Your Raspberry Pi will
automatically reboot in order for the changes to take place.</p>



<h3>Step 6</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="300" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-44.png" alt="" class="wp-image-187" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-44.png 400w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-44-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>After your Raspberry Pi has rebooted, test the Power button by holding it for a second. The LED will start blinking followed by your Raspberry Pi shutting down. You can turn on your pi by pressing the Power button again.<br> </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="228" src="http://argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-48.png" alt="" class="wp-image-191" srcset="https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-48.png 619w, https://www.argon40.com.br/learn/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-48-300x111.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></figure></div>
